							<p>I worked in a group project that allowed me to reinforce my programming skills. As the leader of a team of 4 people, I developed a food pantry application in Java which will be used in campus to allow students to select from available products ahead of time. The interface was made using JavaFx FXML, and the software can be accessed as an admin or a student. All the recipes and available products are stored in a MySQL database. </p>
